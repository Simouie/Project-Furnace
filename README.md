# Project Furnace
The goal of this project is to create an add-on that works alongside
[Foundry](https://github.com/ILoveAGoodCrisp/Foundry) and
the [Halo Asset Blender Development Toolset](https://github.com/General-101/Halo-Asset-Blender-Development-Toolset)
to help users bring levels from Halo 3 and Halo 3: ODST to Halo: Reach.

Foundry is add-on for Blender that helps users produce assets for the later games of the Halo series, such as Halo: Reach.
Because the asset pipeline changed significantly in the transition from Halo 3: ODST to Halo: Reach, 
Foundry is practically essential to bring new or greatly modified assets to those later games in the series.

At the time when the project began, Foundry did not have a feature that helps users bring a level from an earlier game to a later one.
If people wanted to bring a level from Halo 3: ODST to Halo: Reach, they need to manually set everything up in Blender or find ways to automate that.
Because levels in Halo tend to be complex, the process is both tedious and prone to human error.

This project was intended to fill that gap. With the click of a button, the add-on takes imported values and uses them in the appropriate systems of Foundry.
The numerous settings that can be applied to hundreds of objects and materials in a level for Halo can be automatically carried over, with only minimal effort from the user.

As of the latest developments for Foundry, this project is no longer needed.
