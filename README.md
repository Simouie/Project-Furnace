# Project Furnace
The goal of this project is to create an add-on that works alongside 
[Foundry](https://github.com/ILoveAGoodCrisp/Foundry) and
the [Halo Asset Blender Development Toolset](https://github.com/General-101/Halo-Asset-Blender-Development-Toolset)
to help users bring levels created for Halo 3 and Halo 3: ODST to Halo: Reach.

Foundry is an add-on for Blender that helps users produce assets for later games of the Halo series,
including Halo: Reach, Halo 4, and the remastered multiplayer component of Halo 2 Anniversary.
Because the asset pipeline changed so much in the transition from Halo 3: ODST to Halo: Reach, 
Foundry is practically essential for bringing new or modified assets to those later games in the series.

At the time when this project began,
Foundry did not have a feature that helps users bring a level from an earlier game to a later one.
If users wanted to properly import a level from Halo 3: ODST for Halo: Reach, 
they must manually set everything up in Blender or they must find their own ways to automate that.
The levels in Halo tend to be complex, so that process can be painfully tedious, and prone to human error.

This project was intended to fill that gap. 
Numerous settings can be applied to hundreds of objects and materials in a level for Halo.
With the click of a button, the add-on takes the imported values and uses them in the appropriate systems of Foundry.
Everything will be automatically carried over, with only minimal effort from the users.

As of the latest developments for Foundry, this project is no longer needed.
